# UnofficialCalamityWhips

Code for the Unofficial Calamity Whips Mod, which was merged with the Catalyst Mod.
This mod will not have new content additions, besides QOL and bug fixes, as such I wanted to open source the code.

The mod is heavily built upon the ExampleMod example code, so big thanks to them.

A lot of this mod reuses projectiles from vanilla and calamity, it is a little bit janky at time, but you can use this code as an example.
