Do you like whips? Do you like Calamity? So do we! 
Unofficial Calamity Whips is a mod that aims to add several whips to the Calamity mod, in order to fill in progression gaps for summoner whip builds.


DISCLAIMER: Unofficial Calamity Whips is in no way affiliated with the Calamity Dev team. It is just a mod for fans of Calamity, created by a fan of Calamity.

Currently the mod adds 20 new whips and 8 new accessories to the game, all of which can be crafted with Calamity items.
The config contains an option to multiple every whip's damage by a modifier from 50% to 150%, in case you feel the weapons are too over or underpowered for your taste.
